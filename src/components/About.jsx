        <br />I started coding in middle school using Visual Basic 6. I was
        mostly creating hex/memory editors and packet loggers for online games
        in C# and VB6. I've made the switch to Web Development and couldn't be
        happier. I love Front End design and working closely with customer
        facing UI. I graduated from Flatiron bootcamp where I really got to put
        everything together and dive into the full stack! I've worked
        extensively with Rails on backends for it's simplicity and opinionated
        code, and React/Redux for it's reusability on the frontend, I'm a
        passionate coder and pride myself in learning new concepts quickly!
